# Hello!

Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm an algorithm developer & data scientist working at [Wahoo Fitness](http://wahoofitness.com), with a [PhD](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000128846) in applied mathematics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I studied Computational Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University. 

My hobbies are running and starting new Github projects that never make it out of coding purgatory.
