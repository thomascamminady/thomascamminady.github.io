# Hello!

Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm an algorithm developer & data scientist working at Wahoo Fitness, with a PhD in applied mathematics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I studied Computational Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University. 

My hobbies are running and starting new Github projects that never make it out of coding purgatory.

You can have a look at my [Github](https://github.com/thomascamminady) profile, check out my profile on  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camminady/), my [CV](https://camminady.dev/cv), or just send me a [mail](mailto:scarab73_tutors@icloud.com).
