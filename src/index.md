# Hello!

Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm an algorithm developer & data scientist working at [Wahoo Fitness](http://wahoofitness.com), with a [PhD](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000128846) in applied mathematics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I studied Computational Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University. 

You can have a look at my [CV](https://camminady.dev/cv), check out my profiles on [Github](https://github.com/thomascamminady) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camminady/), or  send me a [mail](mailto:scarab73_tutors@icloud.com). There's also a [page](https://camminady.dev/projects) listing random projects of mine.
