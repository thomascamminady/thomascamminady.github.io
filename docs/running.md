# Running Watch Wishlist

Specifically, I'd love to see this implemented in Garmin watches.

-   An alert that informs you when you have forgotten to un-pause an activity.
-   Or, alternatively, an option to have the watch keep on recording even while it is paused. Once the run is finished, you should have the option to "paste" the segment back into your activity. This way you could undo the situations where you forgot that your watch was still paused.
-   Pacing metronome. I know that there exists a metronome option and you can e.g. set it to 180BPM and have it beep every third beep. But I'm talking about a metronome for track sessions. Say you should do 80 second laps, this would be an option where you can set your metronome to beep every 20 seconds. It should be easy to update the frequency of the beeps for situations where you do intervals at different paces. This would be a "pacer" option.
